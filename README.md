# Setting Up a Serverless Angular Project

This guide will help you set up a serverless application with an Angular frontend and a serverless backend hosted on AWS using AWS Lambda and DynamoDB. It is designed for users with no coding knowledge, providing step-by-step instructions.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following:

- **AWS Account**: Create an account on [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) if you donâ€™t have one.
- **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface with your account details. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html).
- **Node.js and npm**: Install Node.js and npm from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Angular CLI**: Install the Angular Command Line Interface. Instructions are available [here](https://angular.io/cli).

## Backend Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Download the project repository to your local machine.

- Command: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/my-serverless-app.git`
- Command: `cd my-serverless-app/backend`

### Step 2: Install Serverless Framework

Install the Serverless Framework, which will help you manage the serverless backend.

- Command: `npm install -g serverless`

### Step 3: Install Project Dependencies

Navigate to the backend directory of the project and install the necessary dependencies.

- Command: `npm install`

### Step 4: Configure Serverless Framework

1. Open the `serverless.yml` file in the backend directory.
2. Update the file with your AWS account details and configure the DynamoDB table if needed.
3. Ensure the table name in `serverless.yml` matches the table name used in your Lambda functions.

### Step 5: Deploy the Backend

Deploy the serverless application to AWS. This will set up the necessary AWS Lambda functions and DynamoDB tables.

- Command: `serverless deploy`

After deployment, note the API endpoints provided by the Serverless Framework.

## Frontend Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Download the project repository to your local machine if not already done.

- Command: `git clone https://github.com/risen-one-technologies/senior-project-template.git`
- Command: `cd senior-project-template/frontend`

### Step 2: Install Angular Project Dependencies

Navigate to the frontend directory of the project and install the necessary dependencies.

- Command: `npm install`

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

Start the development server to preview the Angular application.

- Command: `ng serve`

### Step 4: Build the Project

Build the project to prepare it for deployment. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/frontend` directory.

- Command: `ng build --prod`

### Step 5: Deploy the Frontend

Ensure that the build output directory (`dist/frontend`) is correctly set up in the backend serverless configuration. Refer to the backend README for more details on deploying the frontend with the backend.
