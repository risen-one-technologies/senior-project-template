Risen One Senior Project - Team 1

Sprint 1:
Below I have create a general UX design for us to follow when building our application. The following link is to a Google Drive with the Azure file that you can download,
otherwise I have provided a video that breifly covers it. 

**Note: I will be working on getting still shots put into the drive as well and for our next sprint I will be working
on a designer reference guide that we all can follow so everything is consistent.
